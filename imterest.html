<h2>My Interests</h2>
<p>Earlier in my self tab I mentioned some of my interests already, here I'll be going more in to depth on why I'm interested in them.</p>
<p><b>Video Games</b><br>I've been plaing video games for as long as I can remember and longer. In fact, my mom says I started playing games whenever she bought a console for herself with the game <i>Ms.Pac-Man</i>. At that time I was only around two years old and I've been playing games ever since then.</p>
<p><b>Writing</b><br>Ever since I wrote my first poem for class in 8th grade I felt like I really enjoyed writing. For me it was a great way to put my thoughts and feelings out there without necessarily having to express them verbally to the world.</p>
<p><b>Reading</b><br>I think reading and writing kind of go hand in hand; something English teachers say quite often is how to become a better writer you have to becom a better reader and vice versa. Reading for me is just another nice way to pass the time when I don't have much else to do.</p>
<p><b>Resting</b><br>On my self page I also including "resting" as one of the things I like to do in my free time. Honestly that was just me saying "I like to sleep a lot" in a nicer way. Sleeping is a nice way to pass time whenever I'm bored or waiting for something. It also keeps me feeling more rested.</p>
